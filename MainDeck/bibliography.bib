  abstract = {In this paper we construct a non-commutative geometry over a configuration space of gauge connections and show that it gives rise to a candidate for an interacting, non-perturbative quantum gauge theory coupled to a fermionic field on a curved background. The non-commutative geometry is given by an infinite-dimensional Bott-Dirac type operator, whose square gives the Hamilton operator, and which interacts with an algebra generated by holonomy-diffeomorphisms. The Bott-Dirac operator and the associated Hilbert space relies on a metric on the configuration space of connections, which effectively works as a covariant ultra-violet regulator. We show that the construction coincides with perturbative quantum field theory in a local limit. Questions concerning Lorentz invariance and the fermionic sector as well as the issue of existence are left open.},

  abstract = {The Faddeev-Popov gauge fixing in Yang-Mills theory is interpreted as equivariant localization. It is shown that the Faddeev-Popov procedure amounts to a construction of a symplectic manifold with a Hamiltonian group action. The BRST cohomology is shown to be equivalent to the equivariant cohomology based on this symplectic manifold with Hamiltonian group action. The ghost operator is interpreted as a (pre)symplectic form and the gauge condition as the moment map corresponding to the Hamiltonian group action. This results in the identification of the gauge fixing action as a closed equivariant form, the sum of an equivariant symplectic form and a certain closed equivariant 4-form which ensures convergence. An almost complex structure compatible with the symplectic form is constructed. The equivariant localization principle is used to localize the path integrals onto the gauge slice. The Gribov problem is also discussed in the context of equivariant localization principle. As a simple illustration of the methods developed in the paper, the partition function of N=2 supersymmetric quantum mechanics is calculated by equivariant localization},

In the sphere case, this condition is expressed by an inequality with respect to its dimension and a degree of the differential of the function \$F\$.

  abstract = {We state some new results about the configuration space of pure Yang-Mills theory. These results come from the study of the kinetic energy term of the Lagrangian of the theory. This term defines a riemannian metric on the space of non-equiva{$\acute{\iota}$}ent gauge potentials. We develop a riemannian calculus on the configuration space, compute the riemannian connection, the curvature tensor, andsolve for thegeodesies, etc. We show that theGribov ambiguity is more than an artefact of the choice of a gauge condition, andis related to the existence of conjugate points onthe geodesies, and is thus anintrinsic feature of the theory.},

The approach is that of "equivariant geometry:" attention is restricted to a special class of fields, those that satisfy a certain kind of rotational symmetry, for which it is proved that (1)a solution to the Yang-Mills equations exists among them; and (2) no solution to the self-duality equations exists among them. The first assertion is proved by an application of the direct method of the calculus of variations (existence and regularity of minimizers), and the second assertion by studying the symmetry properties of the linearized self-duality equations. The same technique yields a new family of nonself-dual solutions on the complex projective plane.},

The analogous statement for SO\textasciitilde -bundles is also proved. The other main series of results concerns gap-phenomena for YangMills fields. As a consequence of the non-linearity of the Yang-Mills equations, we can give explicit C{$^\circ$}-neighbourhoods of the minimal Yang-Mills fields which contain no other Yang-Mills fields. In this part of the study the nature of the group G does not matter, neither is the dimension of the base manifold constrained to be four.},

An advanced neural network classifier and SVM are employed to (1) learn Hodge numbers and report a remarkable improvement over previous efforts, (2) query for favourability, and (3) predict discrete symmetries, a highly imbalanced problem to which both Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique (SMOTE) and permutations of the CICY matrix are used to decrease the class imbalance and improve performance. In each case study, we employ a genetic algorithm to optimise the hyperparameters of the neural network. We demonstrate that our approach provides quick diagnostic tools capable of shortlisting quasi-realistic string models based on compactification over smooth CICYs and further supports the paradigm that classes of problems in algebraic geometry can be machine learned.},

We argue that internal relativity and background independence are the two independent defining principles of Yang--Mills theory. We show that local gauge invariance---heuristically implemented by means of the gauge argument---is a direct consequence of internal relativity. Finally, we analyze the conceptual meaning of BRST symmetry in terms of the invariance of the gauge fixed theory under general local gauge transformations.},

We establish uniqueness of the connection up to a gauge equivalence in the case of trivial line bundles in the smooth category and for the higher rank case in the analytic category, by using geometric analysis methods and essentially only one measurement. Moreover, by using a Runge-type approximation argument along curves to recover holonomy, we are able to uniquely determine both the bundle structure and the connection, but at the cost of having more measurements. Also, we prove that the DN map is an elliptic pseudodifferential operator of order one on the restriction of the vector bundle to the boundary, whose full symbol determines the complete Taylor series of an arbitrary connection, metric and an associated potential at the boundary.},

  abstract = {Instantons, emerged in particle physics, have been intensely studied since the 1970's and had an enormous impact in mathematics since then. In this paper, we focus on one particular way in which mathematical physics has guided the development of algebraic geometry in the past 40+ years. To be precise, we examine how the notion of mathematical instanton bundles in algebraic geometry has evolved from a class of vector bundles over the complex projective 3-space both to a class of torsion free sheaves on projective varieties of arbitrary dimension, and to a class of objects in the derived category of Fano threefolds. The original results contained in this survey focus precisely on the latter direction; in particular, we prove that the classical rank 2 instanton bundles over the projective 3-space are indeed instanton objects for any suitable chamber in the space of Bridgeland stability conditions.},

Since the 1960s, mathematicians have used computers to assist in the discovery of patterns and formulation of conjectures1, most famously in the Birch and Swinnerton-Dyer conjecture2, a Millennium Prize Problem3. Here we provide examples of new fundamental results in pure mathematics that have been discovered with the assistance of machine learning---demonstrating a method by which machine learning can aid mathematicians in discovering new conjectures and theorems. We propose a process of using machine learning to discover potential patterns and relations between mathematical objects, understanding them with attribution techniques and using these observations to guide intuition and propose conjectures. We outline this machine-learning-guided framework and demonstrate its successful application to current research questions in distinct areas of pure mathematics, in each case showing how it led to meaningful mathematical contributions on important open problems: a new connection between the algebraic and geometric structure of knots, and a candidate algorithm predicted by the combinatorial invariance conjecture for symmetric groups4. Our work may serve as a model for collaboration between the fields of mathematics and artificial intelligence (AI) that can achieve surprising results by leveraging the respective strengths of mathematicians and machine learning.},

This inequality was discovered using machine learning to detect relationships between various knot invariants. It has applications to Dehn surgery and to 4-ball genus. We also show a refined version of the inequality where the upper bound is a linear function of the volume, and the slope is corrected by terms corresponding to short geodesics that link the knot an odd number of times.},

The conventional answer is that it would be a reduced theory: a theory that traffics only in structures invariant under the relevant symmetry. In this article, I argue that there is a neglected alternative: one can work with a sophisticated version of the theory, in which the symmetries act as isomorphisms. 1.~ Introduction 2.~ Symmetry 3.~ Reduction 4.~ Sophistication 5.~ Equivalence 6.~ Conclusion Appendix},

This paper seeks to develop the basic tools needed, namely Sobolev Spaces and basic Riemannian geometry, assuming knowledge of Lp spaces and some entry level familiarity with differentiable 2-manifolds. The key steps to solving this Plateau Problem will be: 1) identify the relationship between the area and energy functionals, 2) prove existence and regularity of energy minimizing functions with given boundary values, and 3) properly adjust the boundary values of the minimizing sequence so as to extract a uniformly convergent subsequence. Along the way we will prove some interesting and useful facts about harmonic functions.},

Integrable systems lie on the other extreme. They possess regular, stable, and well-behaved solutions known as solitons and instantons. These solutions play important roles in pure and applied mathematics as well as in theoretical physics where they describe configurations topologically different from vacuum. While integrable equations in lower space-time dimensions can be solved using the inverse scattering transform, the higher-dimensional examples of anti-self-dual Yang-Mills and Einstein equations require twistor theory. Both techniques rely on an ability to represent nonlinear equations as compatibility conditions for overdetermined systems of linear differential equations.},

This work starts by presenting the notion of chain complexes of algebraic structures, and then moves into exploring homology modules and chain homotopies.

D. Groisser and T. Parker (1987, 1989) and S. K.

The purpose of this article is to prove this conjecture under the following additional hypotheses. Suppose that \$g\$ is generic and \$X\$ is simply-connected. If (i) \$G=SU(2)\$ or \$SO(3)\$ and \$b\textasciicircum +(X)=0\$ or (ii) \$G=SO(3)\$ and \$w\_2(P)\textbackslash neq 0\$, where \$w\_2(P)\$ is the second Stiefel-Whitney class of \$P\$, then we prove that the moduli space of \$g\$-anti-self-dual connections on \$P\$ has finite volume and diameter with respect to the \$L\textasciicircum 2\$ metric. Our development of the bubble-tree compactification of the moduli space of \$g\$-anti-self-dual connections --- based on ideas of Sacks and Uhlenbeck for sequences of harmonic maps from the two-sphere (1981), Taubes (1988) for sequences of Yang-Mills connections, and Parker and Wolfson (1993, 1996) for sequences of pseudo-holomorphic maps --- provides one of the key technical tools used in the proof.},

  abstract = {We prove several abstract versions of the Lojasiewicz-Simon gradient inequality for an analytic functional on a Banach space that generalize previous abstract versions of this inequality, weakening their hypotheses and, in particular, the well-known infinite-dimensional version of the gradient inequality due to Lojasiewicz proved by Simon (1983). We also prove that the optimal exponent of the Lojasiewicz-Simon gradient inequality is obtained when the functional is Morse-Bott, improving on similar results due to Chill (2003, 2006), Haraux and Jendoubi (2007), and Simon (1996). In our article arXiv:1903.01953, we apply our abstract Lojasiewicz-Simon gradient inequalities to prove a Lojasiewicz-Simon gradient inequalities for the harmonic map energy functional using Sobolev spaces which impose minimal regularity requirements on maps between closed, Riemannian manifolds. Those inequalities for the harmonic map energy functional generalize those of Kwon (2002), Liu and Yang (2010), Simon (1983, 1985), and Topping (1997). In our monograph arXiv:1510.03815, we prove Lojasiewicz--Simon gradient inequalities for coupled Yang--Mills energy functions using Sobolev spaces which impose minimal regularity requirements on pairs of connections and sections. Those inequalities generalize that of the pure Yang--Mills energy function due to the first author (Theorems 23.1 and 23.17 in arXiv:1409.1525) for base manifolds of arbitrary dimension and due to Rade (1992) for dimensions two and three.},

The theory yields quantum mechanics, general relativity and quantum field theory as limiting cases and is therefore a candidate for a unified physical theory. From the mathematical perspective, causal fermion systems provide a general framework for describing and analyzing non-smooth geometries and "quantum geometries." The dynamics is described by a novel variational principle, the causal action principle. The book includes a detailed summary of the mathematical and physical preliminaries. It explains the physical concepts behind the causal fermion system approach from the basics. Moreover, all the mathematical objects and structures are introduced step by step. The mathematical methods used for the analysis of causal fermion systems and the causal action principle are introduced in depth. Many examples and applications are worked out. The textbook is addressed to master and graduate students in mathematics or physics. Furthermore, it serves as a reference work for researchers working in the field.},

But quarks have never been directly confirmed by experiment because they have never been isolated. The proposition has been that quarks are permanently confined inside hadrons and cannot be liberated in high energy particle collisions. It is expected that pairs (and some triplets) of quarks are attracted by forces which increase linearly with the distance between quarks. Thus when the quarks are near to each other they behave like free particles (``asymptotic freedom''), while when they are separated their attractive forces keep them together in the form of a bound state.

For instantons of Pontryagin index 1 over a compact, simply connected, oriented, positive-definite base manifold, the completion M is Donaldson's compactification; in fact the boundary of the completion is an isometric copy of (M, 4n2g) ([GP2]). In this paper we show that the boundary is, furthermore, a totally geodesic submanifold of the completion. Along the way, we prove a regularity theorem: the continuous extension of g to the ``collar region'' of M is C1,a (in the conventional scale/center coordinates) for small LY{$>$} 0. The proofs rely on some new weighted Sobolev inequalities for concentrated instantons, in which the only dependence of the Sobolev constants on the connection is through the concentration parameter X. The exponent in the weighting function translates into the Holder exponent in the regularity theorem.},

In particular, this interpretation allows one to pose questions that would not have been asked otherwise, such as, "Is there a direct relation between Khovanov homology and the A-polynomial of a knot?" We will explain that the answer to this question is "yes," and introduce a certain deformation of the planar algebraic curve defined by the zero locus of the A-polynomial. This novel deformation leads to a categorified version of the Generalized Volume Conjecture that completely describes the "color behavior" of the colored sl(2) knot homology, and eventually to a similar version for the colored HOMFLY homology. Furthermore, this deformation is strong enough to distinguish mutants, and its most interesting properties include relations to knot contact homology and knot Floer homology.},

We also use the bubble-neck decomposition to prove the energy identity of a sequence of Yang--Mills--Higgs pairs over a four-dimensional compact manifold with uniformly bounded energy.

  abstract = {We propose a paradigm to deep-learn the ever-expanding databases which have emerged in mathematical physics and particle phenomenology, as diverse as the statistics of string vacua or combinatorial and algebraic geometry. As concrete examples, we establish multi-layer neural networks as both classifiers and predictors and train them with a host of available data ranging from Calabi-Yau manifolds and vector bundles, to quiver representations for gauge theories. We find that even a relatively simple neural network can learn many significant quantities to astounding accuracy in a matter of minutes and can also predict hithertofore unencountered results. This paradigm should prove a valuable tool in various investigations in landscapes in physics as well as pure mathematics.},

  abstract = {We present a proof that quantum Yang-Mills theory can be consistently defined as a renormalized, perturbative quantum field theory on an arbitrary globally hyperbolic curved, Lorentzian spacetime. To this end, we construct the non-commutative algebra of observables, in the sense of formal power series, as well as a space of corresponding quantum states. The algebra contains all gauge invariant, renormalized, interacting quantum field operators (polynomials in the field strength and its derivatives), and all their relations such as commutation relations or operator product expansion. It can be viewed as a deformation quantization of the Poisson algebra of classical Yang-Mills theory equipped with the Peierls bracket. The algebra is constructed as the cohomology of an auxiliary algebra describing a gauge fixed theory with ghosts and anti-fields. A key technical difficulty is to establish a suitable hierarchy of Ward identities at the renormalized level that ensure conservation of the interacting BRST-current, and that the interacting BRST-charge is nilpotent. The algebra of physical interacting field observables is obtained as the cohomology of this charge. As a consequence of our constructions, we can prove that the operator product expansion closes on the space of gauge invariant operators. Similarly, the renormalization group flow is proved not to leave the space of gauge invariant operators.},

Some special cases included \textohm -Yang--Mills connections, where \textohm{} is a smooth (may be not closed) (n - 4)-form on X. We extend the known analytic results of pure Yang--Mills connections, which included the monotonicity formula and the {$\varepsilon$}-regularity theorem to the class of inhomogeneous Yang--Mills connections. Using those analytic results, we obtain the energy quantization and Uhlenbeck compactness for the moduli space of inhomogeneous Yang--Mills connections that have a uniformly Ln2-bounded curvature. A removable singularity theorem for singular inhomogeneous Yang--Mills connections on a bundle over the punctured ball is also proved. Finally, we also prove an energy gap result for inhomogeneous Yang--Mills connections under some mild conditions.},

These are in one-to-one correspondence with solutions to the Dirichlet problem for the Yang Mills equations, for small boundary data. We prove the existence of multiple solutions, and, in particular, non minimal ones, and establish a Morse Theory for this non-compact variational problem. In part I, we describe the problem, state the main theorems and do the first part of the proof. This consists in transforming the problem into a finite dimensional problem, by seeking solutions that are approximated by the connected sum of a minimal solution with an instanton, plus a correction term due to the boundary. An auxiliary equation is introduced that allows us to solve the problem orthogonally to the tangent space to the space of approximate solutions. In Part II, the finite dimensional problem is solved via the Ljusternik-Schirelman theory, and the existence proofs are completed. In Part III, we prove that the space of gauge equivalence classes of Sobolev connections with prescribed boundary value is a smooth manifold, as well as some technical lemmas used in Part I. The methods employed still work when the 4-dimensional disk is replaced by a more general compact manifold with boundary, and SU(2) is replaced by any compact Lie group.},

This is equivalent to proving the existence of multiple solutions to the Dirichlet problem for the SU(2)-Yang Mills functional with small boundary data. In the first paper of this series this non-compact variational problem is transformed into the finite dimensional problem of finding the critical points of the function J(q), which is essentially the Yang Mills functional evaluated on the approximate solutions, constructed via a gluing technique. In the present paper, we establish a Morse theory for this function, by means of Ljusternik-Schnirelmann theory, thus complete the proofs of the existence theorems (Theorems 1-3).},

  abstract = {Gauge invariance is the basis of the modern theory of electroweak and strong interactions (the so called Standard Model). The roots of gauge invariance go back to the year 1820 when electromagnetism was discovered and the first electrodynamic theory was proposed. Subsequent developments led to the discovery that different forms of the vector potential result in the same observable forces. The partial arbitrariness of the vector potential A brought forth various restrictions on it. div A = 0 was proposed by J. C. Maxwell; 4-div A = 0 was proposed L. V. Lorenz in the middle of 1860's . In most of the modern texts the latter condition is attributed to H. A. Lorentz, who half a century later was one of the key figures in the final formulation of classical electrodynamics. In 1926 a relativistic quantum-mechanical equation for charged spinless particles was formulated by E. Schrodinger, O. Klein, and V. Fock. The latter discovered that this equation is invariant with respect to multiplication of the wave function by a phase factor exp(ieX/hc) with the accompanying additions to the scalar potential of -dX/cdt and to the vector potential of grad X. In 1929 H. Weyl proclaimed this invariance as a general principle and called it Eichinvarianz in German and gauge invariance in English. The present era of non-abelian gauge theories started in 1954 with the paper by C. N. Yang and R. L. Mills.},

While the critical points of J correspond to Yang--Mills connections on P , its L2-gradient gives rise to a novel system of elliptic equations. This contrasts previous approaches to a study of the Yang--Mills functional via a parabolic gradient flow. We carry out the complete analytical details of our program in the case of a compact two-dimensional base manifold Y . We furthermore discuss its relation to the well-developed parabolic Morse homology of Riemannian surfaces. Finally, an application of our elliptic theory is given to three-dimensional product manifolds Y = {$\Sigma$} \texttimes{} S1.},

  abstract = {A natural gauge-invariant 2-form is introduced on the space of connections over a compact oriented surface with boundary. It is shown that this 2-form descends to the moduli space of flat connections, under a group of based gauge transformations. An explicit expression (in terms of holonomy variations) is given for the resulting 2-form, and it is related to the symplectic structure of the extended moduli space introduced by L. C. Jeffrey.},

This way we obtain a twisted boundary value problem in which the boundary conditions are mixed, of Dirichlet type on some of the Lie-algebra components of the connection A, of Neumann type on others. This problem arises naturally and it can be viewed in the context of generalizing non-linear Hodge theory for connections. We prove a good gauge theorem for this problem. We give an application.},

The briefest, clearest, and most refined account of his influential approach to the subject, the book will be invaluable to all students of philosophy and physics. Quantum mechanics holds a unique place in the history of physics. It has produced the most accurate predictions of any scientific theory, but, more astonishing, there has never been any agreement about what the theory implies about physical reality. Maudlin argues that the very term "quantum theory" is a misnomer. A proper physical theory should clearly describe what is there and what it does--yet standard textbooks present quantum mechanics as a predictive recipe in search of a physical theory. In contrast, Maudlin explores three proper theories that recover the quantum predictions: the indeterministic wavefunction collapse theory of Ghirardi, Rimini, and Weber; the deterministic particle theory of deBroglie and Bohm; and the conceptually challenging Many Worlds theory of Everett. Each offers a radically different proposal for the nature of physical reality, but Maudlin shows that none of them are what they are generally taken to be."--},

The invariants are gauge-theoretic in nature and are close cousins of the much-studied SU(2)-invariants defined over fifteen years ago by Donaldson. On a practical level, the new invariants have proved to be more powerful and have led to a vast generalization of earlier results. This book is an introduction to the Seiberg-Witten invariants.  The work begins with a review of the classical material on Spin \mkbibemph{c} structures and their associated Dirac operators. Next comes a discussion of the Seiberg-Witten equations, which is set in the context of nonlinear elliptic operators on an appropriate infinite dimensional space of configurations. It is demonstrated that the space of solutions to these equations, called the Seiberg-Witten moduli space, is finite dimensional, and its dimension is then computed. In contrast to the SU(2)-case, the Seiberg-Witten moduli spaces are shown to be compact. The Seiberg-Witten invariant is then essentially the homology class in the space of configurations represented by the Seiberg-Witten moduli space. The last chapter gives a flavor for the applications of these new invariants by computing the invariants for most Kahler surfaces and then deriving some basic toological consequences for these surfaces.},

If we consider a sequence of such connections \$\$A\_i\$\$, then it is understood by Tian (Ann Math 151(1):193--268, 2000) that up to subsequence we can converge \$\$A\_i\textbackslash rightarrow A\$\$to a singular limit connection such that the energy measures converge \$\$\textbar F\_\{A\_i\}\textbar\textasciicircum 2 dv\_g\textbackslash rightarrow \textbar F\_A\textbar\textasciicircum 2dv\_g +\textbackslash nu \$\$, where \$\$\textbackslash nu =e(x)d\textbackslash lambda \textasciicircum\{n-4\}\$\$is the \$\$n-4\$\$rectifiable defect measure. Our main result is to show, without additional assumptions, that for \$\$n-4\$\$a.e. point the energy density e(x) may be computed explicitly as the sum of the bubble energies arising from blow ups at x. Each of these bubbles may be realized as a Yang Mills connection over \$\$S\textasciicircum 4\$\$itself. This energy quantization was proved in Rivi\`ere (Commun Anal Geom 10(4):683--708, 2002) assuming a uniform \$\$L\textasciicircum 1\$\$hessian bound on the curvatures in the sequence. In fact, our second main theorem is to show this hessian bound holds automatically. Precisely, given a connection A as above we have the a-priori estimate \$\$\textbackslash int \_M \textbar\textbackslash nabla \textasciicircum 2 F\_A\textbar{} {$<$} C(\textbackslash Lambda ,\textbackslash dim G,M)\$\$for the curvature. It is important to note this result is proved in tandem with the energy quantization, and not before it. Indeed, we will in fact prove an effective version of the energy identity, and it is this effective version which will lead to both the \$\$L\textasciicircum 1\$\$hessian bound and the classical energy quantization results. In the course of the proof we will provide a quantitative version of the bubble tree decomposition which hold in all dimensions with effective estimates for a fixed stationary connections. To produce strongest estimates in the paper we introduce an \$\$\textbackslash epsilon \$\$-gauge condition, which generalizes the usual Coulomb gauge and which will exist, with effective control, even over singular regions. On these \$\$\textbackslash epsilon \$\$-gauges we will provide a new superconvexity estimate which will be a key tool in analyzing higher-dimensional annular regions.},

This paper provides basic tools for considering the dynamics of the hyperbolic Yang--Mills equation in an arbitrary topological class at an optimal regularity. We generalize the standard notion of a topological class of connections on \$\textbackslash mathbb R\textasciicircum\{d\}\$, defined via a pullback to the one-point compactification \$\textbackslash mathbb S\textasciicircum\{d\} = \textbackslash mathbb R\textasciicircum\{d\} \textbackslash cup \textbackslash\{\textbackslash infty\textbackslash\}\$, to rough connections with curvature in the critical space \$L\textasciicircum\{\textbackslash frac\{d\}\{2\}\}(\textbackslash mathbb R\textasciicircum\{d\})\$. Moreover, we provide excision and extension techniques for the Yang--Mills constraint (or Gauss) equation, which allow us to efficiently localize Yang--Mills initial data sets. Combined with the results in the previous paper \textbackslash cite\{OTYM2\}, we obtain local well-posedness of the hyperbolic Yang--Mills equation on \$\textbackslash mathbb R\textasciicircum\{1+d\}\$ \$(d \textbackslash geq 4)\$ in an arbitrary topological class at optimal regularity in the temporal gauge (where finite speed of propagation holds). In addition, in the energy subcritical case \$d = 3\$, our techniques provide an alternative proof of the classical finite energy global well-posedness theorem of Klainerman--Machedon \textbackslash cite\{KlMa2\}, while also removing the smallness assumption in the temporal-gauge local well-posedness theorem of Tao \textbackslash cite\{TaoYM\}. Although this paper is a part of a larger sequence, the materials presented in this paper may be of independent and general interest. For this reason, we have organized the paper so that it may be read separately from the sequence.},

This paper provides the key gauge-dependent analysis of the hyperbolic Yang--Mills equation. We consider topologically trivial solutions in the caloric gauge, which was defined in the first paper arXiv:1709.08599 using the Yang--Mills heat flow. In this gauge, we establish a strong form of local well-posedness, where the time of existence is bounded from below by the energy concentration scale. Moreover, we show that regularity and dispersive behavior of the solution persists as long as energy dispersion is small. We also observe that fixed-time regularity (but not dispersive) properties in the caloric gauge may be transferred to the temporal gauge without any loss, proving as a consequence small data global well-posedness in the temporal gauge. The results in this paper are used in the subsequent papers arXiv:1709.08604, arXiv:1709.08606 to prove the sharp Threshold Theorem in caloric gauge in the trivial topological class, and the dichotomy theorem in arbitrary topological classes.},

The Threshold Theorem asserts that topologically trivial solutions with energy below twice the ground state energy are global and scatter. The Dichotomy Theorem applies to solutions in arbitrary topological class with large energy, and provides two exclusive alternatives: Either the solution is global and scatters, or it bubbles off a soliton in either finite time or infinite time. Using the caloric gauge developed in the first paper, the continuation/scattering criteria established in the second paper, and the large data analysis in an arbitrary topological class at optimal regularity in the third paper, here we perform a blow-up analysis which shows that the failure of global well-posedness and scattering implies either the existence of a soliton with at most the same energy bubbling off, or the existence existence of a nontrivial self-similar solution. The proof is completed by showing that the latter solutions do not exist.},

While the moduli space, its topology and metric, may be constructed in any dimension, the tools we use in the proofs are four-dimensional, and hence so is our main result.},

This is a major obstruction for studying the variations of this important Lagrangian in high dimensions. The present paper generalizes the previous result of the authors from 'The resolution of the Yang-Mills Plateau problem in super-critical dimensions', Adv. Math. 316 (arxiv:1306.2010), valid in \$5\$ dimensions to arbitrary dimension and introduces a space of so called 'weak connections' for which we prove the weak sequential closure under Yang-Mills energy control. We also establish a strong approximation property of any weak connection by smooth connections away from codimension \$5\$ polyhedral sets. This last property is used in a subsequent work in preparation for establishing the partial regularity property for general stationary Yang-Mills weak connections.},

  abstract = {I develop a theory of symplectic reduction that applies to bounded regions in Yang-Mills theory and electromagnetism. In this theory gauge-covariant superselection sectors for the electric flux through the boundary of the region play a central role: within such sectors, there exists a natural, canonically defined, symplectic structure for the reduced Yang-Mills theory. This symplectic structure does not require the inclusion of any new degrees of freedom. In the non-Abelian case, it also supports a family of Hamiltonian vector fields, which I call "flux rotations," generated by smeared, Poisson-non-commutative, electric fluxes. Since the action of flux rotations affects the total energy of the system, I argue that flux rotations fail to be dynamical symmetries of Yang-Mills theory restricted to a region. I also consider the possibility of defining a symplectic structure on the union of all superselection sectors. This in turn requires including additional boundary degrees of freedom aka "edge modes." However, unless the new edge modes model a material physical system located at the boundary of the region, I argue that the phase space extension by edge modes is inherently ambiguous and gauge-breaking.},

The speed of the mean curvature flow of spacelike surfaces in a null hypersurface is the projection of the codimension-two mean curvature vector onto the null hypersurface. We impose fairly mild conditions on the null hypersurface. Then for an outer un-trapped initial surface, a condition which resembles the mean-convexity of a surface in Euclidean space, we prove that the mean curvature flow exists for all times and converges smoothly to a marginally outer trapped surface (MOTS). As an application we obtain the existence of a global foliation of the past of an outermost MOTS, provided the null hypersurface admits an un-trapped foliation asymptotically.},

  abstract = {In this paper we define instanton Floer homology groups for a pair consisting of a compact oriented 3-manifold with boundary and a Lagrangian submanifold of the moduli space of flat SU(2)-connections over the boundary. We carry out the construction for a general class of irreducible, monotone boundary conditions. The main examples of such Lagrangian submanifolds are induced from a disjoint union of handle bodies such that the union of the 3-manifold and the handle bodies is an integral homology 3-sphere. The motivation for introducing these invariants arises from our program for a proof of the Atiyah-Floer conjecture for Heegaard splittings. We expect that our Floer homology groups are isomorphic to the usual Floer homology groups of the closed 3-manifold in our main example and thus can be used as a starting point for an adiabatic limit argument.},

  abstract = {A fundamental nonlinear object in differential geometry is a map between manifolds. If the manifolds have Riemannian metrics, then it is natural to choose representaives for maps which respect the metric structures of the manifolds. Experience suggests that one should choose maps which are minima or critical points of variational integrals. Of the integrals which have been proposed, the energy has attracted most interest among analysts, geometers, and mathematical physicists. Its critical points, the harmonic maps, are of some geometric interest. They have also proved to be useful in applications to differential geometry. Particularly one should mention the important role they play in the classical minimal surface theory. Secondly, the applications to Kahler geometry given in [S], [SiY] illustrate the usefulness of harmonic maps as analytic tools in geometry. It seems to the author that there is good reason to be optimistic about the role which the techniques and results related to this problem can play in future developments in geometry.},

Critical points of the functional satisfy a system of second-order partial differential equations, the Yang---Mills equations. If, in particular, the critical point is a minimum, it satisfies a first-order system, the self-dual or anti-self-dual equations. Here, we exhibit an infinite number of finite-action nonminimal unstable critical points. They are obtained by constructing a topologically nontrivial loop of connections to which min---max theory is applied. The construction exploits the fundamental relationship between certain invariant instantons on S4 and magnetic monopoles on H3. This result settles a question in gauge field theory that has been open for many years.},

  abstract = {We investigate the long time behaviour of the Yang-Mills heat flow on the bundle \$\textbackslash mathbb\{R\}\textasciicircum 4\textbackslash times SU(2)\$. Waldron \textbackslash cite\{Waldron2019\} proved global existence and smoothness of the flow on closed \$4-\$manifolds, leaving open the issue of the behaviour in infinite time. We exhibit two types of long-time bubbling: first we construct an initial data and a globally defined solution which \{\textbackslash sl blows-up\} in infinite time at a given point in \$\textbackslash mathbb R\textasciicircum 4\$. Second, we prove the existence of \{\textbackslash sl bubble-tower\} solutions, also in infinite time. This answers the basic dynamical properties of the heat flow of Yang-Mills connection in the critical dimension \$4\$ and shows in particular that in general one cannot expect that this gradient flow converges to a Yang-Mills connection. We emphasize that we do not assume for the first result any symmetry assumption; whereas the second result on the existence of the bubble-tower is in the \$SO(4)\$-equivariant class, but nevertheless new.},

This book, a succinct introduction to the subject by renown mathematician Norman Steenrod, was the first to present the subject systematically. It begins with a general introduction to bundles, including such topics as differentiable manifolds and covering spaces. The author then provides brief surveys of advanced topics, such as homotopy theory and cohomology theory, before using them to study further properties of fibre bundles. The result is a classic and timeless work of great utility that will appeal to serious mathematicians and theoretical physicists alike},

There are three main ingredients. The first is Price's monotonicity formula, which allows us to assert that the curvature is small not only in the                                                                                               L                       2                                          L\textasciicircum 2                                                                  norm, but also in the Morrey norm                                                                                               M                       2                                                n                                                    /                                                  2                                                                 M\_2\textasciicircum\{n/2\}                                                                  . The second ingredient is a new inductive (averaged radial) gauge construction and truncation argument which allows us to approximate a singular gauge as a weak limit of smooth gauges with curvature small in the Morrey norm. The second ingredient is a variant of Uhlenbeck's lemma, allowing one to place a smooth connection into the Coulomb gauge whenever the Morrey norm of the curvature is small; This variant was also proved independently by Meyer and Rivi\`ere. It follows easily from this variant that a                                                                                               W                                                1                         ,                         2                                                                 W\textasciicircum\{1,2\}                                                                  -connection can be placed in the Coulomb gauge if it can be approximated by smooth connections whose curvatures have small Morrey norm.},

It has been of fundamental importance to find out how those two objects interact in many geometric and physical problems. A typical example of this relation is that the Picard group of line bundles on an algebraic manifold is isomorphic to the group of divisors, which is generated by holomorphic hypersurfaces modulo linear equivalence. A similar correspondence can be made between the K-group of sheaves and the Chow ring of holomorphic cycles. There are two more very recent examples of such a relation. The mirror symmetry in string theory has revealed a deeper phenomenon involving special Lagrangian cycles (cf. [SYZ]). On the other hand, C. Taubes has shown that the Seiberg-Witten invariant coincides with the Gromov-Witten invariant on any symplectic 4-manifolds. In this paper, we will show another natural interaction between Yang-Mills connections, which are critical points of a Yang-Mills action associated to a vector bundle, and minimal submanifolds, which have been studied extensively for years in classical differential geometry and the calculus of variations.},

The study of the Yang-Mills equation and its cousins gave rise to the Donaldson invariants and more recently, the Seiberg-Witten invariants. Those invariants have enabled us to prove a number of striking results for low dimensional manifolds, particularly, 4-manifolds. The theory of Gromov-Witten invariants was established by using solutions of the Cauchy-Riemann equation. These solutions are often refered as pseudo-holomorphic maps which are special minimal surfaces studied long in geometry. It is certainly not the end of applications of nonlinear partial differential equations to geometry. In this talk, we will discuss some recent progress on nonlinear partial differential equations in geometry. We will be selective, partly because of my own interest and partly because of recent applications of nonlinear equations. There are also talks in this ICM to cover some other topics of geometric analysis by R. Bartnik, B. Andrew, P. Li and X.X. Chen, etc.},

  abstract = {Characteristic classes, which are abstract topological invariants associated with vector bundles, have become an important notion in modern physics with surprising real-world consequences. As a representative example, the incredible properties of topological insulators, which are insulators in their bulk but conductors on their surface, can be completely characterized by a specific characteristic class associated with their electronic band structure, the first Chern class. Given their importance to next generation computing and the computational challenge of calculating them using first-principles approaches, there is a need to develop machine learning approaches to predict the characteristic classes associated with a material system. To aid in this program we introduce the \{\textbackslash emph\{Haldane bundle dataset\}\}, which consists of synthetically generated complex line bundles on the \$2\$-torus. We envision this dataset, which is not as challenging as noisy and sparsely measured real-world datasets but (as we show) still difficult for off-the-shelf architectures, to be a testing ground for architectures that incorporate the rich topological and geometric priors underlying characteristic classes.},

We also see that this translates into different behaviour for the harmonic map flow. In [11] we obtained results, assuming nonzero bubble point density for certain bubbles, forcing the harmonic map flow to converge uniformly and exponentially to its limit. This involved proving a type of nondegeneracy for the harmonic map energy (a `quantization' estimate') and an estimate on certain bubble scales (a `repulsion' estimate). Here we show that without the nonzero bubble point density hypothesis, both the quantization and repulsion estimates fail, and we construct a flow in which the convergence is no longer exponentially fast.},

The relation between the Yang--Mills equation and symplectic structure is explicitly clarified, and the moduli space of Yang--Mills connections over a compact symplectic manifold is constructed. Furthermore, the absolute minima of the Yang--Mills functional are characterized, and finite dimensionality of the moduli space of the minimizers of the Yang--Mills functional is shown.},

If an Uhlenbeck limit is anti-self-dual and has vanishing self-dual second cohomology, then no bubbling occurs and the flow converges exponentially. We also recover Taubes's existence theorem, and prove asymptotic stability in the appropriate sense.},

We then introduce and study the quantitative stratification \$S\textasciicircum k\_\{\textbackslash epsilon\}(A)\$. Roughly speaking, \$S\textasciicircum k\_\{\textbackslash epsilon\}(A)\$ consists of points at which no tangent measure of \$A\$ is \$\textbackslash epsilon\$-close to being \$(k+1)\$-symmetric. In the main Theorem, we show that \$S\textasciicircum k\_\{\textbackslash epsilon\}\$ is \$k\$-rectifiable and satisfies the Minkowski volume estimate \$\textbackslash text\{Vol\}(B\_r(S\textasciicircum k\_\{\textbackslash epsilon\})\textbackslash cap B\_1)\textbackslash le Cr\textasciicircum\{n-k\}\$.

  abstract = {In this Letter we supervisedly train neural networks to distinguish different topological phases in the context of topological band insulators. After training with Hamiltonians of one-dimensional insulators with chiral symmetry, the neural network can predict their topological winding numbers with nearly 100\% accuracy, even for Hamiltonians with larger winding numbers that are not included in the training data. These results show a remarkable success that the neural network can capture the global and nonlinear topological features of quantum phases from local inputs. By opening up the neural network, we confirm that the network does learn the discrete version of the winding number formula. We also make a couple of remarks regarding the role of the symmetry and the opposite effect of regularization techniques when applying machine learning to physical systems.},
